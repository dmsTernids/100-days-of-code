# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: September 26, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Started learning bootstrap via freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** I really struggled learning all of it from the start as my previous knowledge only came in school. Trying to get better in coding. (Hang in there!)

### Day 02: September 27, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Finished bootstrap course on freecodecamp.org
**Thoughts**: It was true. freecodecamp.org should not be my only source of learning. I started to study further from other sources i found over the internet. (Hang in there!)
